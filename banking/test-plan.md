# Banking System Test Plan

## Codebase Analysis

### 1. Overview of Codebase Structure and Key Components

#### a. Main Components and Relationships
- Banking Module:
  - `banking.ts`: Core banking operations implementation
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `banking.test.ts`: Existing test suite
  - `banking-spec.md`: Business requirements specification

#### b. Areas of Complexity/Risk
- Transaction handling and concurrency
- Money-related calculations and precision
- Error handling and validation
- Account state management
- Transaction ID generation uniqueness

#### c. Key Functionalities Requiring Testing
- Account creation
- Withdrawal processing
- Transaction recording
- Error handling for various scenarios
- Currency handling
- Balance management

#### d. External Dependencies
- TypeScript
- Vitest testing framework
- Node.js environment

### 2. Critical Areas for Testing
- Account creation validation
- Withdrawal validation logic
- Transaction processing accuracy
- Error handling paths
- Currency validation
- Balance calculations
- Transaction ID generation
- Data persistence (currently not implemented)
- Concurrency handling (currently not implemented)

### 3. Potential Risks/Challenges
- Floating-point arithmetic for monetary values
- Race conditions in concurrent transactions
- Transaction ID collisions
- Missing data persistence layer
- Limited currency validation
- No audit trail implementation
- No authentication/authorization
- Missing input sanitization

### 4. Assumptions
- Development environment: Node.js with TypeScript
- Single-threaded execution model
- In-memory data storage
- No external service dependencies
- No persistence requirements
- No authentication/authorization requirements
- No specific performance requirements

## Test Plan

### 1. Introduction

#### Objectives
- Ensure reliability of banking operations
- Validate business rules compliance
- Verify data integrity
- Identify potential security issues
- Ensure proper error handling

#### Scope
- Account management functionality
- Transaction processing
- Error handling
- Data validation
- Currency operations

#### References
- `banking-spec.md`
- TypeScript documentation
- Vitest documentation

### 2. Test Strategy

#### Test Levels

##### Unit Testing
```typescript
// Example structure for account creation tests
describe('Account Creation', () => {
  test('valid account data', () => {});
  test('missing required fields', () => {});
  test('invalid currency format', () => {});
});
```

##### Integration Testing
```typescript
// Example structure for transaction flow tests
describe('Transaction Flow', () => {
  test('withdrawal affects account balance', () => {});
  test('transaction recording', () => {});
});
```

##### System Testing
- End-to-end transaction flows
- Performance under load
- Data consistency checks

##### Acceptance Testing
- Business requirements validation
- User journey validation

#### Test Types
1. Functional Testing
   - Account creation
   - Withdrawal processing
   - Error handling
   - Currency validation

2. Non-functional Testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing
   - Usability testing
   - Maintainability testing

3. Regression Testing
   - Automated test suite execution
   - Change impact analysis

#### Test Environment Requirements
- Node.js v18+
- TypeScript 5.8.2
- Vitest 3.0.9
- Test data generation tools
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### 3. Test Cases

#### High-level Test Scenarios

##### Account Creation
1. Create account with valid data
2. Attempt creation with missing fields
3. Validate currency formats
4. Verify owner information

##### Withdrawal Processing
1. Valid withdrawal within balance
2. Insufficient funds
3. Invalid amount
4. Currency mismatch
5. Invalid account ID

##### Transaction Recording
1. Transaction ID uniqueness
2. Timestamp accuracy
3. Balance updates
4. Transaction history

#### Detailed Test Cases

```typescript
// Account Creation
interface AccountCreationTest {
  input: BankAccount;
  expected: BankAccount | WithdrawalError;
}

const accountCreationTests: AccountCreationTest[] = [
  {
    name: 'Valid account creation',
    input: {
      id: 'acc123',
      balance: 1000,
      currency: 'USD',
      owner: {
        id: 'own123',
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe'
      }
    },
    expected: {/* expected result */}
  },
  // Additional test cases...
];

// Withdrawal Processing
interface WithdrawalTest {
  account: BankAccount;
  withdrawal: WithdrawalRequest;
  expected: WithdrawalResult | WithdrawalError;
}

const withdrawalTests: WithdrawalTest[] = [
  {
    name: 'Successful withdrawal',
    account: {/* account data */},
    withdrawal: {/* withdrawal request */},
    expected: {/* expected result */}
  },
  // Additional test cases...
];
```
